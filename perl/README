Net-SDP version
===============

Net::SDP is a parser and generator for

SDP - Session Description Protocol (rfc2327)

Have a look at the example scripts for basic outline of
how to use the module.


INSTALLATION

	I use Module::Build to build and install the module.
	To install this module type the following:

		perl Build.PL
		./Build
		./Build test

	And then as root:
	
		./Build install

	Module::Build is available in the Debian package:

		libmodule-build-perl


EXAMPLES

	sdp2rat
		Launch rat (Robust Audio Tool) with parameters taken from
		an SDP file. This used to be a stand alone script which
		I converted to use Net::SDP.

	parse_and_generate.pl
		This script should parse in an SDP file and re-create it.
		The input and output should be the same (apart from a couple 
		of line re-orderings perhaps). If you find a valid SDP file 
		that Net::SDP cannot re-produce, please email it to me so 
		that I can make corrections :)

	sdpinfo.pl
		Parses and displays basic information about an SDP session.
		Shows example of how to process each of the Time and Media
		descriptions.

	simple_generate.pl
		Creates a simple SDP session, with single time and media
		description. Prints the resulting SDP data to STDOUT. 


DEPENDENCIES

	This module depends upon Sys::Hostname and Net::hostent,
	which are both standard modules in recent perl distributions.
	
	LWP is recommended, but not required.
